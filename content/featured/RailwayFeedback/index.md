This Feedback Detection and Classification system is a machine learning-based research project that automatically categorizes user feedback into predefined categories such as Police, Food, Cleanliness, and Maintenance. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a smooth user interface, while the back-end, powered by Django (Python), handles the processing and storage of feedback. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system intelligently analyzes feedback and classifies it into relevant categories, making it easier for organizations to manage and address user concerns effectively.
