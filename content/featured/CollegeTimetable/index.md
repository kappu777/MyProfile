This project is designed to develop a software solution for colleges to efficiently manage and maintain "Time Tables" for both students and staff. It enables the creation, editing, and viewing of schedules in a structured and user-friendly manner. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while Django (Python) is used on the back-end to handle data securely and ensure smooth system performance. This solution helps automate the scheduling process, minimizing conflicts and improving overall academic coordination.
